Creating an AGENTS.md file at the start of your project is a great way to document its structure, purpose, and coding standards, especially if you plan to leverage AI agents (Claude, Codex, etc) for development or code generation.

This file should describe your project, outline its architecture, and list all the conventions and rules that AI tools should follow when interacting with your code.

By clearly defining these guidelines, you ensure that AI-assisted coding aligns with your expectations and maintains consistency across the project.

Tools like the Laravel Boost library can help streamline the creation of this file and make it easier to integrate AI agents effectively.
